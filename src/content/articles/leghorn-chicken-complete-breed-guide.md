Leghorn chickens are the undisputed egg-laying champions of the poultry world. If you've ever bought white eggs from a grocery store, there's a very good chance they came from a Leghorn. These energetic, efficient birds produce 280 to 320 large white eggs per year, and they do it while eating less feed than most other breeds. Here's everything you need to know about raising Leghorns in your backyard.

## Leghorn Chicken History and Origins

Leghorns originated in Tuscany, Italy, and take their name from the port city of Livorno (anglicized to "Leghorn"). They were first exported to North America in the 1820s, arriving in Connecticut around 1828.

American breeders refined the Leghorn significantly from its Italian ancestors, selecting for higher egg production and a more compact body. By the early 1900s, the White Leghorn had become the dominant commercial egg-laying breed in the United States, a position it still holds today.

The breed's success in commercial farming is no accident. Leghorns convert feed to eggs more efficiently than almost any other chicken, they mature quickly, and they rarely go broody (which means fewer interruptions in laying). Industrial egg operations chose them for a reason.

For backyard keepers, though, Leghorns offer something commercial farms don't care about: personality. These birds are active, curious, and entertaining to watch, even if they're not the cuddliest chickens you'll ever meet.

## What Do Leghorn Chickens Look Like?

Leghorns have a sleek, athletic build that's all business. They're built for egg production, not meat.

**Size:** Hens weigh 4.5 to 5.5 pounds, roosters 6 to 7.5 pounds. They're noticeably lighter and leaner than dual-purpose breeds like [Wyandottes](/articles/wyandotte-chicken-complete-breed-guide) or [Plymouth Rocks](/articles/plymouth-rock-complete-breed-guide).

**Comb:** Most Leghorns have a large single comb that flops to one side in hens. This floppy comb is iconic but can be vulnerable to frostbite in cold climates. A rose comb variety also exists and handles winter much better.

**Legs:** Clean, bright yellow legs. No feathering on the feet.

**Body:** Slim, upright posture with a broad tail held high. They look alert and ready to move at all times, because they usually are.

**Earlobes:** White earlobes, which is a reliable indicator that a breed lays white eggs.

## How Many Eggs Do Leghorns Lay?

This is where Leghorns truly shine. A healthy Leghorn hen will lay **280 to 320 large white eggs per year**, putting them at or near the top of any [best egg-laying breeds](/articles/best-egg-laying-breeds) list. That's 5 to 6 eggs per week, nearly every single week.

Here's what makes their production so impressive:

**Early maturity.** Leghorns start laying around 4.5 to 5 months of age, which is earlier than most breeds. You'll be collecting eggs while keepers with other breeds are still waiting.

**Rarely broody.** Unlike breeds such as [Silkies](/articles/silkie-chicken-complete-breed-guide) or [Buff Orpingtons](/articles/buff-orpington-complete-breed-guide) that frequently go broody, Leghorns almost never do. That means fewer interruptions in their laying cycle and more eggs in your basket.

**Feed efficiency.** Leghorns produce more eggs per pound of feed than virtually any other breed. They eat about 1/4 pound of feed per day, and they turn that feed into eggs at an incredible rate. If you're tracking the [cost of raising chickens](/articles/how-much-does-it-cost-to-raise-chickens), Leghorns give you the best return on feed investment.

**Winter laying.** They'll slow down in winter like all breeds, but they bounce back faster once daylight hours increase. Supplemental lighting in the coop can keep production more consistent through the darker months.

The trade-off? Leghorn eggs are white and medium to large. If you want colorful eggs, you'll need to look at breeds like [Easter Eggers](/articles/easter-egger-complete-breed-guide). But for sheer volume, Leghorns are tough to beat.

## Leghorn Chicken Temperament

Leghorns are not lap chickens. Let's get that out of the way right up front.

These birds are active, alert, independent, and flighty. They'd rather be foraging 50 feet away from you than sitting in your lap. They're smart and curious, but they're also nervous around humans unless they've been handled extensively from chick age.

**High energy.** Leghorns are always on the move. They're excellent foragers who'll cover a lot of ground hunting bugs and scratching through leaves. If you free-range your flock, Leghorns will take full advantage of the space.

**Noisy.** Compared to quieter breeds like [Wyandottes](/articles/wyandotte-chicken-complete-breed-guide) or Silkies, Leghorns are talkers. Hens have a loud egg song and they're quick to sound alarm calls. If you've got close neighbors, this is worth considering.

**Flighty.** Leghorns can fly surprisingly well for a chicken. They'll clear a 4-foot fence without much effort and regularly roost in trees if given the chance. If you need to contain them, plan on a tall fence or a covered run.

**Not great in mixed flocks with docile breeds.** Leghorns can be pushy and dominant in the pecking order. They're not aggressive per se, but their energy and assertiveness can stress out calmer breeds. They do best with other active breeds or in a Leghorn-only flock.

That said, some backyard keepers absolutely love their Leghorns' personalities. They're entertaining, resourceful, and have more character than many docile breeds. They're just not the type to sit quietly in your arms.

## Leghorn Color Varieties

When most people think "Leghorn," they picture a white chicken. But the breed comes in quite a few color varieties.

The American Poultry Association recognizes these Leghorn varieties:

- **White** - By far the most common. Pure white feathers, yellow legs, bright red comb. This is the commercial egg industry standard.
- **Brown** - Rich, dark reddish-brown. Brown Leghorns lay slightly fewer eggs than whites but they're beautiful birds.
- **Light Brown** - Lighter version of the Brown with more golden tones.
- **Dark Brown** - Darker variation with deeper mahogany coloring.
- **Black** - Solid black with a greenish sheen.
- **Buff** - Warm golden-buff color.
- **Red** - Deep reddish coloring.
- **Columbian** - White body with black hackle and tail feathers.
- **Silver** - White with black patterning.

Each variety comes in both single comb and rose comb versions, though single combs are far more common. If you live in a cold climate, the rose comb variety is worth seeking out because it resists frostbite much better.

## Are Leghorns Good for Beginners?

It depends on what you're looking for. Leghorns are an excellent choice for beginners who want maximum eggs with minimum feed cost. They're hardy, healthy, and don't require special care.

**Where Leghorns work well for beginners:**
- You want lots of eggs and don't care about meat production
- You have space for free-ranging or a large run
- You don't mind active, independent birds
- You're comfortable with chickens that aren't cuddly
- You want efficient feed-to-egg conversion

**Where Leghorns might frustrate beginners:**
- You want friendly, easy-to-handle birds
- You have small children who want pet chickens
- You're in a neighborhood where noise is a concern
- You have a small, low-fenced yard
- You plan to mix them with very docile breeds

For first-time keepers who want a more balanced experience (friendly temperament plus good egg production), breeds like [Plymouth Rocks](/articles/plymouth-rock-complete-breed-guide), [Australorps](/articles/australorp-complete-breed-guide), or Buff Orpingtons might be a better starting point. See our full guide on the [best chicken breeds for beginners](/articles/best-chicken-breeds-for-beginners) for more options.

But if eggs are your priority and you've got the space, Leghorns won't disappoint.

## How to Care for Leghorn Chickens

### Housing

Leghorns need about 4 square feet of coop space per bird and 10+ square feet in the run. Since they're active birds, more space is always better. A cramped Leghorn is a stressed Leghorn, and that means more pecking and noise.

The biggest housing challenge with Leghorns is containment. These birds can fly. If your run isn't covered, expect them to go over the fence. A 6-foot fence works for most, but some determined hens will clear even that. Covered runs or clipped flight feathers are common solutions.

Roosts should be higher than you'd place them for heavier breeds since Leghorns prefer sleeping as high as possible. A well-ventilated [coop](/articles/how-to-build-a-chicken-coop) is important, especially in summer, because Leghorns handle heat well but still need airflow.

![White Leghorn chickens in a shaded farm enclosure with proper housing](/images/articles/leghorn-chickens-farm-enclosure.jpg)

### Feeding

Leghorns are efficient eaters. They consume about 1/4 pound of layer feed per day, which is less than most dual-purpose breeds. Standard [layer feed](/articles/what-do-chickens-eat-complete-feeding-guide) with 16% protein works well. Supplement with oyster shell for strong eggshells, since these hens are producing a lot of them.

If you free-range your Leghorns, they'll supplement their own diet with bugs, seeds, and greens. They're some of the best foragers around, which further reduces your feed costs.

Leghorns rarely have weight problems because they're so active. Obesity is much less of a concern than it is with heavier breeds.

### Seasonal Considerations

**Heat tolerance:** Leghorns handle heat better than most breeds. Their lean build and large combs help dissipate body heat. They originated in Mediterranean Italy, after all. They'll still need shade and fresh water in extreme heat, but they won't struggle as much as heavily feathered breeds.

**Cold tolerance:** This is the Leghorn's weak spot. Their large single combs are prone to frostbite in freezing temperatures. Rose comb varieties handle cold much better. In cold climates, you'll want to apply petroleum jelly to combs and wattles during freezing weather, or choose the rose comb variety from the start.

### Predator Awareness

Leghorns are actually better at avoiding predators than many breeds. Their flighty nature and ability to fly means they can escape ground predators more effectively. They're alert and quick to sound the alarm. Still, a secure [predator-proof setup](/articles/chicken-predators-how-to-protect-your-flock) is essential, especially for aerial predators.

## Leghorns vs Other Egg-Laying Breeds

**Leghorn vs Australorp:** [Australorps](/articles/australorp-complete-breed-guide) lay nearly as many eggs (250+/year) and are much friendlier. If you want eggs plus a pet, go Australorp. If you want maximum eggs per pound of feed, Leghorn wins.

**Leghorn vs Rhode Island Red:** [Rhode Island Reds](/articles/rhode-island-red-complete-breed-guide) produce 250 to 300 brown eggs per year and offer more meat. They're hardier in cold weather. Leghorns edge them out on pure egg numbers and feed efficiency.

**Leghorn vs Easter Egger:** [Easter Eggers](/articles/easter-egger-complete-breed-guide) give you colorful blue and green eggs but only 200 to 250 per year. Leghorns double down on volume over variety.

**Leghorn vs Wyandotte:** [Wyandottes](/articles/wyandotte-chicken-complete-breed-guide) lay about 200 to 220 eggs and are calmer, prettier, and better in cold climates. Leghorns produce 30% to 50% more eggs but lack the friendly temperament.

## Common Health Issues

Leghorns are one of the healthiest chicken breeds, which is part of why they dominate commercial production. They've been bred for hardiness and efficiency for generations. But a few things to watch for:

**Frostbitten combs.** The single comb is their biggest vulnerability in cold climates. Frostbitten combs turn black at the tips and can cause pain and reduced egg production. Prevention is simple: petroleum jelly on combs before freezing nights, or choose rose comb varieties.

**Egg-laying related issues.** High-production hens can be more prone to egg binding, prolapse, and reproductive cancers as they age. Making sure hens get enough calcium (oyster shell always available) and aren't overweight helps reduce these risks.

**Stress from confinement.** Leghorns that don't get enough space can develop feather picking and other stress behaviors. They need room to roam and forage. If you must keep them confined, make the run as large as possible and provide enrichment like hanging cabbage, perches at different heights, and dust bath areas.

**Parasites.** Like all chickens, Leghorns can get mites and lice. Their lighter feathering actually makes it easier to spot parasites during health checks compared to heavily feathered breeds. Regular [coop maintenance](/articles/chicken-coop-bedding-pine-shavings-vs-straw-vs-sand) and dust bathing areas keep parasites in check.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many eggs does a Leghorn chicken lay per day?

A healthy Leghorn hen lays about one egg per day during peak production, averaging 5 to 6 eggs per week. Over a full year, that adds up to 280 to 320 eggs. Production naturally slows during shorter winter days and during their annual molt.

### Are Leghorn chickens noisy?

Yes, Leghorns are noisier than average. They have a loud egg song, they're quick to sound alarm calls, and they generally vocalize more than calmer breeds. If noise is a concern in your neighborhood, quieter breeds like Wyandottes or Australorps might be a better fit.

### Can Leghorn chickens fly?

Leghorns are strong flyers for a chicken breed. They can easily clear a 4-foot fence and some will get over 6 feet. If you need to contain them, a covered run or clipped flight feathers are your best options. Many free-range keepers let their Leghorns roost in trees by choice.

### What color eggs do Leghorn chickens lay?

Leghorns lay white eggs. They're one of the few breeds where you can predict egg color with near certainty. Their white earlobes are a telltale sign of white egg production. The eggs are medium to large and have excellent shell quality.

### How long do Leghorn chickens live?

Leghorns typically live 5 to 8 years, with some reaching 10 years or more under ideal conditions. However, their egg production drops significantly after 2 to 3 years. Commercial operations replace hens around 18 months, but backyard Leghorns can remain productive layers for 3 to 4 years.

Leghorns won't win any cuddliness contests, but they're the gold standard when it comes to filling your egg basket. If egg production is your top priority and you've got the space for an active, independent bird, they're one of the best breeds you can choose. Want to compare more options?
