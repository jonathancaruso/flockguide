## What Makes Silkies Different From Other Chickens?

Silkies aren't your average chicken. They've got a list of unusual traits that sets them apart from every other breed out there.

**Feathers that feel like silk.** Unlike normal chicken feathers, Silkie feathers lack the tiny hooks (called barbicels) that hold feather strands together. The result? Feathers that look and feel more like fur or silk than anything you'd expect on a bird. This also means their feathers aren't waterproof, which is an important care detail we'll cover below.

**Black skin and bones.** Silkies have a condition called fibromelanosis, which gives them dark blue-black skin, bones, and even meat. It looks striking and it's completely harmless. In many Asian cultures, Silkie meat is actually prized for its supposed medicinal properties.

**Five toes.** Most chickens have four toes. Silkies have five on each foot. It's one of the breed standards that judges look for at poultry shows.

**Blue earlobes.** Another quirky feature. Most breeds have red or white earlobes, but Silkies sport distinctive turquoise-blue ones.

**Walnut comb.** Instead of the typical single comb you'll see on breeds like [Rhode Island Reds](/articles/rhode-island-red-complete-breed-guide) or [Plymouth Rocks](/articles/plymouth-rock-complete-breed-guide), Silkies have a small, lumpy walnut-shaped comb.

They're classified as bantams in the United States, typically weighing 2 to 3 pounds for hens and 3 to 4 pounds for roosters. Some countries do recognize standard-sized Silkies, but you'll mostly find bantams in the U.S.

## Silkie Chicken Temperament and Personality

If you want a chicken that'll sit in your lap, follow you around the yard, and tolerate being carried by kids, Silkies are your breed. They're consistently ranked among the friendliest, most docile chickens you can own.

![Silkie hen with chick walking together in a natural outdoor setting](/images/articles/silkie-hen-with-chick.jpg)

Silkies are calm, quiet, and rarely aggressive. Roosters tend to be gentler than roosters of other breeds, though they'll still protect their hens. Hens are famous for going broody, and they make exceptional mothers. Many chicken keepers actually use Silkie hens as "surrogate moms" to hatch eggs from other breeds, or even ducks.

Their gentle nature does come with a downside: Silkies tend to be low on the pecking order. If you've got assertive breeds like Leghorns or Rhode Island Reds in the same flock, your Silkies might get picked on. They do best with other gentle breeds or in a Silkie-only flock.

This temperament makes them popular as pet chickens and great for families with young children. They don't mind being held, and they won't put up a fuss when kids want to carry them around.

## How Many Eggs Do Silkie Chickens Lay?

Let's be honest here: if you're raising chickens primarily for eggs, Silkies probably aren't your best bet. They lay about **100 to 120 small cream-colored eggs per year**, which works out to roughly 2 to 3 eggs per week during their laying season.

For comparison, high-production breeds like [Australorps](/articles/australorp-complete-breed-guide) or [Easter Eggers](/articles/easter-egger-complete-breed-guide) can lay 250+ eggs per year. That's a big difference.

Silkie eggs are on the smaller side since they're bantams. They taste just as good as any other chicken egg, and the yolks tend to be a rich, deep yellow. You'll just need more of them for a recipe.

The biggest challenge with Silkie egg production is broodiness. These hens go broody frequently, sometimes multiple times per year. When a hen goes broody, she stops laying and sits on eggs (or where eggs used to be) for weeks. If you don't want chicks, you'll need to break the broodiness to get her laying again.

Silkies typically start laying around 7 to 9 months of age, which is later than most breeds. They're also one of the first breeds to start laying again in late winter as daylight hours increase.

## Silkie Chicken Colors and Varieties

The American Poultry Association recognizes several Silkie color varieties:

- **White** - The most common and popular color. Pure white feathers with that signature fluffy look.
- **Black** - Solid black feathers with a greenish sheen in sunlight.
- **Blue** - A slate gray-blue color. Blue Silkies don't breed true, meaning breeding two blues gives you roughly 50% blue, 25% black, and 25% splash offspring.
- **Buff** - A warm golden-tan color, similar to [Buff Orpingtons](/articles/buff-orpington-complete-breed-guide).
- **Splash** - White base with irregular splashes of blue-gray. Quite eye-catching.
- **Partridge** - A complex pattern of brown, gold, and black. Less common but beautiful.
- **Gray** - Silver-gray feathering.

You'll also find non-recognized colors from breeders, including lavender, cuckoo, red, and paint (white with random black patches). These can't be shown competitively but they're perfectly fine as backyard pets.

Both bearded and non-bearded varieties exist. Bearded Silkies have extra feathering around their face and under the beak, giving them an even fluffier appearance.

## Are Silkies Good for Beginners?

Yes, with a few caveats. Silkies are an excellent choice for beginners who want chickens as pets or for light egg production. Their gentle temperament means you won't deal with aggressive birds, and they're easy to handle.

Here's where beginners should pay attention:

**Pros for beginners:**
- Incredibly friendly and easy to tame
- Great with kids
- Don't need as much space (they're small and don't fly)
- Quiet compared to many breeds
- Hardy in cold weather despite their looks

**Challenges for beginners:**
- Low egg production compared to other beginner-friendly breeds
- Feathers aren't waterproof, so they need dry shelter
- Hard to sex as chicks (most hatcheries sell them straight-run, meaning 50/50 chance of roosters)
- Can be bullied by larger, more assertive breeds
- Prone to a few specific health issues (more on that below)

If you're looking for a dual-purpose egg-and-pet breed, you might want to start with something like a [Buff Orpington](/articles/buff-orpington-complete-breed-guide) instead. But if you're primarily after friendly backyard companions that happen to lay some eggs, Silkies are hard to beat.

## How to Care for Silkie Chickens

Silkies need the same basics as any chicken, with a few breed-specific considerations.

### Housing

Since Silkies can't fly, they need lower roosts (12 to 18 inches off the ground) or they'll just sleep on the floor. Many Silkie owners skip traditional roosts altogether and provide wide, low platforms instead. You'll need about 4 square feet of coop space per bird, which is actually less than standard-sized breeds.

Their feathers don't repel water, so a dry coop is especially important. Make sure your [coop has good ventilation](/articles/how-to-build-a-chicken-coop) without drafts, and that the roof doesn't leak. In rainy weather, Silkies should have access to covered runs.

### Feeding

Silkies eat the same [feed as other chickens](/articles/what-do-chickens-eat-complete-feeding-guide). Standard layer feed works fine for hens, and you can supplement with treats like mealworms, vegetables, and scratch grains. Since they're bantams, they'll eat less than standard-sized birds, roughly 1/4 pound of feed per day compared to 1/3 pound for larger breeds.

Make sure your [feeders are the right height](/articles/best-chicken-feeders-and-waterers-2026) for these shorter birds. Hanging feeders should be at their back height.

### Grooming

That fluffy crest on top of their head can obstruct their vision. Some owners trim the crest feathers around the eyes so their Silkies can see better. This is especially important for predator awareness. You should also check for dirty feathers around the vent area, since their fluffy plumage can trap droppings.

Their feathered feet need monitoring too. Check for mud buildup, scaly leg mites, and bumblefoot. Keeping the run area dry and clean goes a long way toward preventing foot problems.

### Cold and Heat Tolerance

Despite looking delicate, Silkies actually handle cold weather pretty well. Their dense, fluffy feathering provides good insulation. They're more vulnerable to wet cold than dry cold, so keep them dry and they'll do fine in winter. Check out our guide on [keeping chickens warm in winter](/articles/how-to-keep-chickens-warm-in-winter) for more tips.

Heat is a bigger concern. All that fluff can cause overheating in hot summers. Provide shade, fresh cool water, and good ventilation when temperatures climb above 85°F.

## What Breeds Mix Well With Silkies?

Silkies do best with other calm, gentle breeds. Good flockmates include:

- **Cochins** - Similar temperament, fluffy, and gentle
- **Brahmas** - Larger but very docile and won't bully Silkies
- **Buff Orpingtons** - Friendly and laid-back
- **Easter Eggers** - Generally mellow and a nice complement
- **Polish** - Another crested breed with a calm personality

Avoid mixing Silkies with aggressive or high-energy breeds like Leghorns, Rhode Island Reds, or Welsummers. The size and temperament mismatch usually means Silkies end up at the bottom of the pecking order. If you do [introduce new birds](/articles/how-to-introduce-new-chickens-to-your-flock), go slow and watch for bullying.

## Common Health Issues in Silkies

Silkies are generally healthy birds with a lifespan of 7 to 9 years. But their unique features come with a few breed-specific health concerns.

**Marek's Disease.** Silkies seem to be more susceptible to Marek's disease than many other breeds. Vaccination at the hatchery is strongly recommended. If you're buying from a breeder, ask whether the chicks were vaccinated.

**Parasites.** That dense fluff is a paradise for lice and mites. Regular health checks are essential. Part the feathers and look at the skin, especially around the vent and under the wings. Diatomaceous earth in dust bath areas can help prevent infestations.

**Wry Neck.** Also called crook neck or torticollis, this condition causes the head to twist backward or to the side. Silkies are more prone to it than other breeds. It's often linked to vitamin E and selenium deficiency and can usually be treated with supplements if caught early.

**Respiratory Issues.** The crest feathers can trap moisture near their face, making them slightly more prone to respiratory problems. Good coop ventilation and dry conditions help prevent this.

**Predator Vulnerability.** This isn't a disease, but it's a real concern. Silkies can't see well through their crests, can't fly to escape, and their dark meat actually attracts some [predators](/articles/chicken-predators-how-to-protect-your-flock). Secure housing is non-negotiable for this breed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much do Silkie chickens cost?

Silkie chicks typically cost $5 to $10 from hatcheries when bought straight-run (unsexed). Sexed pullets run $10 to $15. Show-quality Silkies from breeders can cost $20 to $50 or more per bird. Adult hens often sell for $20 to $30 locally.

### Can Silkie chickens live with regular chickens?

They can, but you need to be careful about which breeds you pair them with. Silkies do well with other gentle breeds like Cochins, Brahmas, and Orpingtons. Avoid housing them with aggressive breeds that might bully them. Always monitor the flock after introductions.

### Do Silkie chickens need special food?

No, Silkies eat the same layer feed as other chickens. Since they're bantams, they'll eat a bit less. Some owners add vitamin E supplements as a preventive measure against wry neck, but standard poultry nutrition works fine for most Silkies.

### How long do Silkie chickens live?

Silkies typically live 7 to 9 years with proper care, which is about average for most chicken breeds. Some well-cared-for Silkies have been known to live even longer. Good nutrition, clean housing, and regular health checks are the keys to a long life.

### Are Silkie chickens loud?

Silkies are one of the quieter chicken breeds, making them a solid choice for suburban or urban flocks where noise is a concern. Hens make soft clucking sounds and the occasional egg song. Roosters do crow, but their crow is softer and less piercing than larger breeds.
