# 10 Best Chicken Breeds for Beginners

Picking your first chicken breed is one of the most fun parts of getting started. It is also one of the most important decisions you will make. The right breed can mean the difference between a smooth first year and a frustrating one.

Not all chickens are created equal. Some are bred to lay tons of eggs. Some are bred to be calm and friendly. Some handle cold winters like champs. Others fall apart when the temperature drops below freezing.

For beginners, you want a breed that checks as many boxes as possible: good egg production, friendly personality, hardy in various climates, and easy to find at your local feed store.

Here are our top 10 picks, based on feedback from experienced keepers and data from university poultry extension programs.

## 1. Rhode Island Red

If you could only pick one breed for a backyard flock, this would be it. Rhode Island Reds are the Toyota Camry of the chicken world: reliable, practical, and everywhere for a reason.

**Egg production:** 250 to 300 brown eggs per year. That is roughly 5 to 6 eggs per week at peak production. Few breeds can match this kind of output consistently.

**Temperament:** Friendly but independent. They are not typically lap chickens, but they are curious and will follow you around the yard. Some hens can be a little bossy with other breeds, so keep that in mind if you are mixing flocks.

**Hardiness:** Excellent in both cold and hot climates. Their single comb can get frostbite in extreme cold, but with a dry, ventilated coop they do fine in most of the US.

**Why beginners love them:** They are low-maintenance, excellent foragers, and practically bombproof. If you forget to close the coop door one night (please don't make a habit of it), a Rhode Island Red is probably the bird that will survive.

| Stat | Details |
|------|---------|
| Egg Production | 250-300/year |
| Egg Color | Brown |
| Size | Large (6.5-8.5 lbs) |
| Temperament | Friendly, assertive |
| Cold Hardy | Excellent |
| Heat Tolerant | Good |
| Beginner Rating | ★★★★★ |

## 2. Buff Orpington

If Rhode Island Reds are the reliable sedan, Buff Orpingtons are the big fluffy teddy bear of the chicken world. They are gentle, beautiful, and one of the most popular breeds for families with kids.

**Egg production:** 200 to 280 light brown eggs per year. Not quite as prolific as Rhode Island Reds, but still very solid.

**Temperament:** Calm, docile, and affectionate. These birds genuinely seem to enjoy being around people. Many Buff Orpington owners report that their hens will sit in their lap, tolerate being carried, and come running when they see you. They are one of the best breeds for children.

**Hardiness:** Excellent in cold weather thanks to their thick, fluffy feathering. They are not the best in extreme heat, though. In hot climates, make sure they have shade and plenty of water.

**The broody factor:** Buff Orpingtons go broody more than most breeds. That means they will sometimes decide to sit on a clutch of eggs and try to hatch them, even if there is no rooster and the eggs are not fertile. When a hen goes broody, she stops laying. You can break broodiness, but it takes a few days. Something to be aware of.

| Stat | Details |
|------|---------|
| Egg Production | 200-280/year |
| Egg Color | Light brown |
| Size | Large (7-8 lbs) |
| Temperament | Calm, docile, friendly |
| Cold Hardy | Excellent |
| Heat Tolerant | Fair |
| Beginner Rating | ★★★★★ |

## 3. Plymouth Rock (Barred Rock)

The Barred Rock is one of the oldest American chicken breeds, and it has stuck around this long because it does everything well. Good eggs, good personality, good in most climates. No real weaknesses.

**Egg production:** 200 to 280 brown eggs per year. Consistent layers that keep going through winter better than many breeds.

**Temperament:** Calm and friendly. Not quite as cuddly as Buff Orpingtons, but easy to handle and not flighty. They get along well with other breeds in mixed flocks.

**Hardiness:** Very cold hardy. Their tight, dense feathering insulates them well. They handle heat reasonably well too, though not as well as lighter breeds.

**Appearance:** The classic black-and-white barred (striped) pattern makes them one of the most recognizable chickens. They are a beautiful bird.

| Stat | Details |
|------|---------|
| Egg Production | 200-280/year |
| Egg Color | Brown |
| Size | Large (7-8 lbs) |
| Temperament | Calm, friendly |
| Cold Hardy | Excellent |
| Heat Tolerant | Good |
| Beginner Rating | ★★★★★ |

## 4. Australorp

The Australorp holds the world record for egg laying: 364 eggs in 365 days, set by a hen in Australia in the 1920s. Modern Australorps are not quite that productive, but they are still exceptional layers.

**Egg production:** 250 to 300 light brown eggs per year. One of the best layers on this list.

**Temperament:** Quiet, gentle, and a little shy at first. They warm up to people with regular handling. Once they trust you, they are very sweet birds. Their calm nature makes them a good choice for suburban backyards where noise might be an issue.

**Hardiness:** Great in cold weather. Their black feathering absorbs heat, which helps in winter but can make them uncomfortable in very hot summers. Provide shade in warm climates.

**Why they stand out:** If your main goal is eggs and you want a calm, quiet bird, Australorps are hard to beat.

| Egg Production | 250-300/year |
| Egg Color | Light brown |
| Size | Large (6.5-8 lbs) |
| Temperament | Quiet, gentle, shy |
| Cold Hardy | Excellent |
| Heat Tolerant | Fair |
| Beginner Rating | ★★★★☆ |

## 5. Easter Egger

Easter Eggers are not technically a breed (they are a hybrid or mixed variety), but they are one of the most popular backyard chickens in America for one simple reason: colorful eggs.

**Egg production:** 200 to 280 eggs per year in shades of blue, green, olive, or sometimes pink. Each hen lays one color consistently. You will not know what color you get until she starts laying.

**Temperament:** Friendly, curious, and fun to watch. They tend to be active foragers with a lot of personality. Many Easter Egger owners say they are the most entertaining birds in their flock.

**Hardiness:** Generally hardy in both cold and warm climates. Since they are a mixed variety, individual birds can vary.

**The fun factor:** Kids especially love Easter Eggers because of the colorful eggs. Opening the nesting box and finding a blue or green egg never gets old.

**A note on naming:** Feed stores sometimes label Easter Eggers as "Ameraucanas" or "Araucanas," but true Ameraucanas are a specific breed that is harder to find and more expensive. If you are paying $3 to $5 per chick at a feed store, it is almost certainly an Easter Egger. That is totally fine. They are great birds.

|------|---------|
| Egg Production | 200-280/year |
| Egg Color | Blue, green, pink |
| Size | Medium-Large (5-7 lbs) |
| Temperament | Friendly, curious |
| Cold Hardy | Good |
| Heat Tolerant | Good |
| Beginner Rating | ★★★★★ |

## 6. Sussex (Speckled Sussex)

The Speckled Sussex is a gorgeous bird with a personality to match. Their mahogany feathers tipped with white and black give them a unique spotted look that gets more beautiful after each molt.

**Egg production:** 200 to 250 light brown eggs per year. Not the highest on this list, but very respectable.

**Temperament:** Incredibly friendly and curious. Sussex chickens will follow you around the yard, investigate everything you are doing, and generally act like they are your assistant. They are one of the most personable breeds.

**Hardiness:** Good in cold weather. They handle heat reasonably well too. A solid all-climate bird.

**Foraging ability:** Speckled Sussex are outstanding foragers. If you let your birds free-range, these will cover the most ground and find the most bugs. This can lower your feed costs a bit.

| Egg Production | 200-250/year |
| Egg Color | Light brown |
| Size | Large (7-8 lbs) |
| Temperament | Very friendly, curious |
| Cold Hardy | Good |
| Heat Tolerant | Good |
| Beginner Rating | ★★★★☆ |

## 7. Wyandotte (Silver Laced)

Wyandottes are a dual-purpose American breed known for their beautiful laced feather pattern and their rock-solid cold weather performance. If you live somewhere with harsh winters, these belong on your shortlist.

**Egg production:** 200 to 240 brown eggs per year. Slightly lower than some other breeds on this list, but they lay more consistently through winter than many others.

**Temperament:** Calm but can be aloof. They are not aggressive, but they are not the most cuddly breed either. They tend to stick to their own group in mixed flocks.

**Hardiness:** Exceptional cold hardiness. Their rose comb (flat and close to the head) is much less prone to frostbite than single combs. If you live in Minnesota, Maine, or anywhere with brutal winters, Wyandottes are a top pick.

**Appearance:** The Silver Laced variety is stunning. Each feather is white with a black border. They also come in Gold Laced, Blue, and several other patterns.

| Egg Production | 200-240/year |
| Egg Color | Brown |
| Size | Large (6.5-8 lbs) |
| Temperament | Calm, independent |
| Cold Hardy | Exceptional |
| Heat Tolerant | Fair |
| Beginner Rating | ★★★★☆ |

## 8. Leghorn (White)

If pure egg production is your top priority and you do not care as much about personality, Leghorns are the answer. This is the breed that commercial egg farms use, and for good reason.

**Egg production:** 280 to 320 white eggs per year. This is the highest producer on our list. Some Leghorns will lay an egg almost every single day for their first two years.

**Temperament:** Active, flighty, and not very cuddly. Leghorns are more "wild" in personality compared to the docile breeds above. They are not mean, just nervous and busy. Not the best choice if you want a pet chicken.

**Hardiness:** Good in warm climates. Their large single comb makes them more vulnerable to frostbite in cold areas. You can apply petroleum jelly to the comb in winter to help.

**Size:** Leghorns are smaller than most breeds on this list (about 4.5 to 6 pounds). They eat less feed per egg produced, making them the most efficient layers.

**Best for:** People who want maximum eggs and do not mind a more hands-off relationship with their birds.

| Stat | Details |
|------|---------|
| Egg Production | 280-320/year |
| Egg Color | White |
| Size | Medium (4.5-6 lbs) |
| Temperament | Active, flighty |
| Cold Hardy | Fair |
| Heat Tolerant | Excellent |
| Beginner Rating | ★★★☆☆ |

## 9. Cochin

Cochins are the opposite of Leghorns. They are enormous, fluffy, slow-moving, and they lay... okay. People keep Cochins because they are absolutely lovable, not because they are egg machines.

**Egg production:** 150 to 180 brown eggs per year. This is lower than most breeds on this list, but Cochins make up for it in personality.

**Temperament:** Extremely calm, gentle, and friendly. Cochins are basically the labradors of the chicken world. They tolerate handling well, rarely get aggressive, and they are perfect for families with small children.

**Hardiness:** Outstanding cold hardiness thanks to their heavy feathering, including feathered feet and legs. They struggle in hot, humid weather, though. Keep them cool in summer.

**The broody factor:** Cochins go broody frequently. If you want a hen that will hatch eggs for you, a Cochin is a natural incubator. If you just want eggs for breakfast, broodiness can be annoying.

**Best for:** Families, people who want a pet chicken, and anyone who just wants big fluffy birds wandering around the yard.

|------|---------|
| Egg Production | 150-180/year |
| Egg Color | Brown |
| Size | Very Large (8-11 lbs) |
| Temperament | Extremely calm, gentle |
| Cold Hardy | Excellent |
| Heat Tolerant | Poor |
| Beginner Rating | ★★★★☆ |

## 10. ISA Brown (Red Sex-Link)

ISA Browns are a commercial hybrid bred specifically for maximum egg production in backyard settings. They are not a heritage breed, but if you want eggs above all else, they deliver.

**Egg production:** 300 to 350 brown eggs per year. This is the highest production on our list. ISA Browns will lay reliably for their first 2 to 3 years, then production drops off more sharply than heritage breeds.

**Temperament:** Friendly, calm, and easy to handle. Most ISA Browns are quite docile and tolerate being picked up. They adapt well to confinement or free range.

**Hardiness:** Good in most climates. Not quite as cold hardy as some heritage breeds, but they do fine with a proper coop.

**The trade-off:** Because they are bred for maximum production, ISA Browns tend to have shorter productive lifespans. Heritage breeds lay fewer eggs per year but keep laying for more years. It depends on what matters to you.

| Stat | Details |
|------|---------|
| Egg Production | 300-350/year |
| Egg Color | Brown |
| Size | Medium (5-6 lbs) |
| Temperament | Friendly, calm |
| Cold Hardy | Good |
| Heat Tolerant | Good |
| Beginner Rating | ★★★★★ |

## How to Choose the Right Breed for You

Here is a quick decision guide:

**Want maximum eggs?** Go with ISA Browns, Leghorns, or Rhode Island Reds.

**Want a family-friendly pet that also lays eggs?** Buff Orpingtons, Cochins, or Speckled Sussex.

**Live in a cold climate?** Wyandottes, Plymouth Rocks, or Australorps.

**Live in a hot climate?** Leghorns, Easter Eggers, or Rhode Island Reds.

**Want colorful eggs?** Easter Eggers (blue/green) or mix with Marans (dark brown) for variety.

**Want a mixed flock?** Grab 2 of each from 2 to 3 breeds. Most of the breeds on this list get along well together.

## Where to Buy Chicks

You have several options:

**Local feed stores** (Tractor Supply, Rural King, local farm stores) carry chicks in spring, usually from February to June. Selection varies, but you will typically find the popular breeds listed above. Chicks run $3 to $5 each.

**Hatcheries** ship day-old chicks through the mail. Yes, really. Popular hatcheries include Murray McMurray, Cackle Hatchery, and Meyer Hatchery. You can order specific breeds and usually need to buy a minimum of 3 to 6 chicks. Expect to pay $3 to $8 per chick plus shipping.

**Local breeders** are great if you want specific varieties or heritage lines. Check Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, or your local poultry club.

**Started pullets** (young hens 16 to 20 weeks old, near laying age) cost more ($15 to $30 each) but skip the brooder phase entirely. If you do not want to deal with chicks, this is the way to go.

## Final Thoughts

You really cannot go wrong with any breed on this list. They are all beginner-friendly for a reason. Pick the one (or two, or three) that sounds most exciting to you, and do not overthink it.

Your first flock is a learning experience no matter what breed you choose. And once you get hooked (and you will), you will probably end up trying other breeds anyway. That is how it works. Nobody stops at their first flock.
