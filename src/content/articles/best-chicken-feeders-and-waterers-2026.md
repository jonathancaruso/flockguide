## Types of Chicken Feeders (and Which to Choose)

Not all feeders are created equal. Here's a quick breakdown of the main styles you'll run into:

**Hanging tube feeders** are the most popular choice for backyard flocks. They hang from the coop ceiling or a hook, which keeps them off the ground and away from bedding. Most hold 10 to 25 pounds of feed. They're affordable, easy to fill, and work well for flocks of 4 to 12 birds.

**Treadle feeders** are the premium option. They have a pedal that chickens step on to open the lid. This keeps mice, rats, sparrows, and rain out of your feed. They cost more upfront ($80 to $200+), but they'll save you money on wasted feed over time. Grandpa's Feeders is the most well-known brand, and for good reason.

**Trough feeders** are long, open containers that sit on the ground. They're cheap and work fine for chicks, but adult birds will scratch feed everywhere. Not ideal for a permanent setup.

**PVC pipe feeders** are a popular DIY option. You can build one for under $15, and they hold a lot of feed. The downside is they can clog if feed gets damp, and they're harder to clean than commercial options.

For most backyard flocks, a **hanging tube feeder** is the sweet spot. If you've got rodent problems or want to go hands-off, step up to a treadle feeder.

## Best Chicken Feeders for Backyard Flocks

### 1. RentACoop 20lb Hanging Chicken Feeder — Best Overall

[RentACoop 20lb Hanging Feeder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079QLMM56?tag=flockguide-20) — ~$35

This is the feeder that comes up over and over again in chicken-keeping communities, and it's earned that reputation. It's made from galvanized steel (not flimsy plastic), holds 20 pounds of feed, and includes a rain guard to keep moisture out.

**Why it works:** The anti-roost cone on top prevents birds from perching and pooping into the feed. The feeding ports are sized so chickens can eat comfortably without flinging feed everywhere. It'll handle a flock of 6 to 12 birds easily.

**One thing to know:** You'll want to hang it at the height of your birds' backs. Too low and they'll bill feed onto the ground.

### 2. Grandpa's Automatic Chicken Feeder — Best for Pest Control

[Grandpa's Feeders Automatic Feeder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EAGFVHC?tag=flockguide-20) — ~$130 (standard) / ~$170 (large)

If rats, mice, or wild birds are raiding your feed, this is the answer. Grandpa's has been making treadle feeders for over 20 years, and they're built like tanks. Galvanized steel construction, waterproof lid, and a weighted step plate that only opens when a chicken (not a sparrow) steps on it.

**Why it works:** The standard size holds 20 pounds and feeds up to 6 birds. The large holds 40 pounds and handles up to 12. You'll train your flock to use it in about a week. Most chickens figure it out in a day or two.

**One thing to know:** It's a bigger investment upfront. But if you're losing $10 to $20 a month in feed to pests, it pays for itself within a year.

### 3. Harris Farms Hanging Poultry Feeder (25lb) — Budget Pick

[Harris Farms 25lb Hanging Feeder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KL17IQ?tag=flockguide-20) — ~$20

This is the no-frills option that gets the job done. It's plastic (not steel), but it holds 25 pounds and feeds 10 to 15 birds. At under $20, it's hard to beat for beginners who are still figuring out their setup.

**Why it works:** Lightweight, easy to fill, and the price is right. Good starter feeder while you decide if you want to upgrade later.

**One thing to know:** Plastic doesn't last as long as galvanized steel, and squirrels can chew through it. Plan on replacing it every year or two.

## Types of Chicken Waterers

Clean water matters even more than clean feed. A chicken drinks about a pint of water per day (more in summer), and dirty water spreads disease fast. Here are your options:

**Nipple waterers** are the gold standard for clean water. Small metal or plastic nipples attach to a bucket or PVC pipe, and chickens peck at them to get a drink. The water stays sealed inside the container, so it never gets dirty. This is what most experienced chicken keepers recommend.

**Cup waterers** work similarly but fill a small cup when the chicken pecks a trigger. They're a good middle ground between nipple and open waterers. Slightly more water waste than nipples, but easier for some birds to learn.

**Bell/gravity waterers** are the traditional red-and-white plastic waterers you see everywhere. Water fills a trough around the base as the birds drink. They're cheap and easy, but the open water gets dirty fast. You'll be scrubbing green algae out of them every few days in warm weather.

**Heated waterers** are essential if you live somewhere with freezing winters. They keep water from turning into a block of ice. You can get heated bases that work with your existing gravity waterer, or buy an all-in-one heated unit.

For most flocks, **nipple waterers** are the way to go. They're cheap, stay clean, and save you the daily chore of dumping and refilling dirty water.

## Best Chicken Waterers for Backyard Flocks

### 1. RentACoop Nipple Waterer Kit — Best Overall

[RentACoop Nipple Waterer Kit (4-Pack)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q36V8PH?tag=flockguide-20) — ~$18

This kit comes with 4 horizontal-style poultry nipples, a drill bit sized to fit perfectly, and silicone plugs for the back side. Drill them into any 5-gallon bucket or food-grade container, and you've got a clean waterer that lasts for years.

**Why it works:** Horizontal nipples are easier for chickens to use than vertical ones, and they rarely leak when installed correctly. One 5-gallon bucket with 3 to 4 nipples will water 10 to 12 birds for several days.

**Why the community loves it:** This is the most-recommended waterer setup on r/BackYardChickens by a wide margin. The kit includes everything, and the nipples don't leak like some cheaper alternatives.

### 2. Farm Innovators Heated Poultry Waterer (3 Gallon) — Best for Winter

[Farm Innovators Heated Waterer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004EGIQLQ?tag=flockguide-20) — ~$55

If you're in a climate where temperatures drop below freezing, you need a heated waterer. This 3-gallon unit has a built-in thermostat that kicks on automatically when temps hit 35°F. It holds enough water for 6 to 10 birds.

**Why it works:** No more trudging out to the coop with warm water every morning. No more cracking ice out of frozen waterers. It just works.

**One thing to know:** You'll need an outdoor-rated extension cord or a power source in your coop. The unit draws about 100 watts when the heater's running.

### 3. Harris Farms Plastic Poultry Waterer (5 Gallon) — Budget Pick

[Harris Farms 5-Gallon Waterer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000KL1MKO?tag=flockguide-20) — ~$22

This is the classic gravity waterer that's been around forever. It holds 5 gallons, which is enough for a week with a small flock. It's cheap and works right out of the box with no setup required.

**Why it works:** Zero learning curve. Fill it, flip it, set it down. Your chickens will drink from it immediately.

**One thing to know:** You'll need to clean it every 2 to 3 days in warm weather. Algae builds up quickly in open-trough waterers. Elevating it on a cinder block helps keep bedding and dirt out.

## How to Pick the Right Size for Your Flock

Here's a rough guide for sizing your feeders and waterers:

**Feeders:**
- 3 to 6 chickens: 10 to 15 lb feeder
- 6 to 12 chickens: 20 to 25 lb feeder
- 12+ chickens: 40 lb feeder or two smaller ones

**Waterers:**
- 3 to 6 chickens: 3 gallon waterer or a 5-gallon bucket with 2 to 3 nipples
- 6 to 12 chickens: 5 gallon waterer or bucket with 4 nipples
- 12+ chickens: Two 5-gallon waterers, placed in different spots

**Pro tip:** It's always better to go slightly bigger than you think you need. Running out of water on a hot summer day is a real risk, and dehydration can kill a chicken faster than almost anything else.

Also consider having at least two water stations if your flock is bigger than 6 birds. Chickens have a pecking order, and lower-ranking birds sometimes get bullied away from a single water source.

## Common Feeder and Waterer Mistakes

**Putting feeders and waterers on the ground.** Chickens scratch constantly. Ground-level feeders fill up with bedding, dirt, and droppings within hours. Hang feeders at back height and elevate waterers on a block or platform.

**Using open waterers in summer without cleaning them.** Warm water plus sunlight equals algae in 48 hours. Either switch to nipple waterers or commit to cleaning your gravity waterer every other day.

**Keeping feed in the coop overnight.** Unless you're using a treadle feeder, an open feeder in the coop is an invitation for mice and rats. Either remove it at night or invest in a rodent-proof option.

**Not providing enough water stations.** One waterer for 15 birds creates bottlenecks. Bullied birds at the bottom of the pecking order may not drink enough, which affects egg production and health.

**Forgetting about winter.** Water freezes. If you live anywhere that drops below 32°F, you need a plan. A heated waterer or a [heated base](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H3PH181?tag=flockguide-20) (~$35) is a worthwhile investment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should you clean chicken feeders and waterers?

Clean waterers every 2 to 3 days in warm weather and weekly in cooler months. Feeders need a thorough scrub every 2 to 4 weeks. Nipple waterers need less frequent cleaning since the water stays sealed, but you should still swap the water in the bucket weekly.

### What type of chicken waterer is best?

Nipple waterers are the best option for most backyard flocks. They keep water clean, prevent algae buildup, and reduce the spread of bacteria. They're cheap to set up (under $20 for a DIY bucket system) and practically eliminate daily water-cleaning chores.

### Can chickens learn to use a treadle feeder?

Yes, most chickens figure out treadle feeders within 3 to 7 days. Start by propping the lid open so they can see the feed inside. Gradually lower the prop over several days until they're stepping on the pedal themselves. Younger birds tend to learn faster than older hens.

### Should I keep food and water inside or outside the coop?

Keep water available both inside and outside during the day. Feed is best kept outside in a covered run area to discourage rodents from entering the coop at night. If you free range during the day, make sure there's water accessible in the yard too.

### How much water does a chicken drink per day?

An average chicken drinks about 1 pint (500ml) of water per day in moderate weather. In summer heat, that can double to a full pint and a half. A 5-gallon bucket will last a flock of 10 birds about 3 to 4 days in normal conditions.

Your feeders and waterers are gear you'll use every single day, so it's worth getting this right from the start.
