## What to Look for in a Chicken Coop Camera

Not every security camera works well in a chicken coop. Here's what matters:

**Night vision** is non-negotiable. Most predator attacks happen at night, and you'll want to peek inside the coop after dark to make sure everyone's roosting safely. Color night vision is a nice bonus, but standard infrared night vision works fine.

**Weather resistance** matters for any camera mounted outside or in an uninsulated coop. Look for an IP65 or IP67 rating. Coops get dusty, humid, and cold, so the camera needs to handle all of that.

**Power source** is usually the deciding factor. If you've got electricity at the coop, wired cameras are simpler and more reliable. If not, you'll need battery or solar power.

**WiFi range** can be tricky. Many coops sit 50-200 feet from the house, which is at the edge of most routers' range. You might need a WiFi extender.

**Motion alerts** let you know when something's happening without constantly watching the feed. The best cameras send a push notification to your phone when they detect movement.

**Two-way audio** is surprisingly useful. You can yell at a raccoon through your phone at 2 AM without leaving bed. Some chicken keepers also use it to call their birds.

**Storage** options matter too. Cloud storage usually requires a subscription. Local storage via microSD card is cheaper long-term.

## 1. Wyze Cam v3 — Best Overall

[Wyze Cam v3 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FKFHL6N?tag=flockguide-20)

**Price:** ~$25-35

The Wyze Cam v3 is the camera that Reddit's backyard chicken community recommends more than any other, and for good reason. At under $30, it's absurdly cheap for what you get.

**What's great:**
- Color night vision (Starlight sensor) that's surprisingly good in low light
- 1080p HD video with a wide 130° field of view
- IP65 weatherproof rating
- Two-way audio with 80dB siren
- Free local storage via microSD card (no subscription needed)

## 2. Reolink Argus 3 Pro + Solar Panel — Best Solar Powered

[Reolink Argus 3 Pro + Solar Panel on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08S7Q3BSH?tag=flockguide-20)

**Price:** ~$90-130 (with solar panel)

If your coop doesn't have electricity, the Reolink Argus 3 Pro with its included solar panel is the best wireless option. The solar panel keeps the battery topped off indefinitely in most climates, meaning you'll never have to bring it inside to charge.

**What's great:**
- 2K (4MP or 5MP depending on version) resolution, sharper than most competitors
- Solar panel included, truly wireless
- Color night vision with spotlight
- 2.4GHz and 5GHz WiFi support
- No monthly subscription needed (free local storage via microSD)
- Smart detection for people, vehicles, and animals
- Two-way audio

**What's not:**
- Higher upfront cost than the Wyze
- Solar panel needs decent sun exposure (won't work well in deep shade)
- Motion-activated recording only (doesn't record 24/7 to save battery)
- WiFi range still matters; you'll need signal at the coop

**Best for:** Coops without electricity. The solar panel is a game-changer for remote setups. Reddit chicken keepers with distant coops often recommend Reolink specifically for this reason.

## 3. Blink Outdoor 4 — Best Battery Life

[Blink Outdoor 4 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B1N5HW22?tag=flockguide-20)

**Price:** ~$80-100

The Blink Outdoor 4 runs on two standard AA lithium batteries and can last up to two years before needing replacements. If you don't want to deal with charging batteries or running cables, this simplicity is hard to beat.

**What's great:**
- Up to 2 years on two AA batteries
- 1080p HD with infrared night vision
- Lightweight and easy to mount
- Built-in siren
- Works with Alexa

**What's not:**
- No color night vision (infrared only, so everything looks black and white at night)
- Requires Blink subscription ($3/month or $30/year) for cloud storage and clip history
- No local storage option without the Blink Sync Module 2 ($35 extra) and USB drive
- Motion-activated only; no 24/7 recording
- 2.4GHz WiFi only

**Best for:** Keepers who want a set-it-and-forget-it camera with minimal maintenance. Great if you don't need color night vision and want the longest possible battery life.

## 4. Ring Stick Up Cam Battery — Best Smart Home Integration

[Ring Stick Up Cam on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BXGJ5YZL?tag=flockguide-20)

**Price:** ~$80-100

If you already use Ring doorbells or other Ring cameras, adding a Stick Up Cam to your coop makes perfect sense. Everything lives in one app, and you can monitor your entire property including the chicken coop from a single dashboard.

**What's great:**
- Three power options: battery, solar panel (sold separately), or plug-in
- Color night vision
- 1080p HD
- Seamless Ring ecosystem integration
- Two-way audio
- Custom motion zones
- Works with Alexa

**What's not:**
- Requires Ring Protect subscription ($4/month) for video history and sharing
- More expensive than Wyze for similar core features
- Battery version needs recharging every 1-3 months depending on activity

**Best for:** Ring ecosystem users who want all their cameras in one app. The optional solar panel makes it a good wireless choice too.

## 5. Coop Smart Cam — Best Purpose-Built Option

[Coop Smart Cam on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DJCGC6LT?tag=flockguide-20)

**Price:** ~$100-130

This is the only camera on the market specifically designed for monitoring chickens. It uses AI trained on poultry behavior to send alerts for things like predator detection, unusual flock behavior, and egg-laying activity.

**What's great:**
- AI specifically trained for chicken/poultry detection
- Predator-specific alerts
- Battery with optional solar panel
- 1080p with night vision
- Designed from the ground up for coop use

**What's not:**
- iOS only (no Android support as of early 2026)
- Newer product with a smaller user community
- More expensive than general-purpose cameras
- Limited track record compared to established brands

**Best for:** Dedicated chicken keepers who want poultry-specific intelligence and don't mind paying a premium. The AI predator alerts are a genuinely useful feature that other cameras don't offer.

## Power Options: Wired vs Battery vs Solar

Your power situation usually narrows your choices immediately:

### Wired (USB or PoE)
- **Most reliable.** Never runs out of power.
- **24/7 recording** possible since power is constant.
- **Cheapest cameras** (Wyze Cam v3 is $25).
- **Challenge:** You need to run a cable to the coop. An outdoor-rated USB extension cord works for short distances.

### Battery
- **No wires needed.** Mount anywhere with WiFi signal.
- **Motion-activated only** to conserve battery.
- **You'll need to recharge or replace batteries** every 1-6 months depending on activity level.
- **Good for:** Coops within WiFi range but without power.

### Solar
- **Truly set-and-forget** once installed.
- **Panel needs sun exposure** (at least 3-4 hours of direct sunlight daily).
- **Higher upfront cost** but zero ongoing power cost.
- **Good for:** Remote coops with no power. Just make sure the panel isn't shaded by the coop roof or trees.

If you're [building a new coop](/articles/how-to-build-a-chicken-coop), running an electrical line to it during construction is worth the effort. It opens up your camera options significantly and lets you add a [heated waterer](/articles/best-chicken-feeders-and-waterers-2026) and supplemental lighting down the road.

## WiFi Range and Connectivity Tips

WiFi range is the most common problem chicken keepers run into with coop cameras. Here's how to solve it:

**Check your signal first.** Walk to your coop with your phone and check the WiFi bars. If you get at least 2 bars, most cameras will work. If the signal is weak or non-existent, you have options:

- **WiFi extender ($20-40).** Place a weatherproof WiFi extender between your house and coop. This is the most common solution.
- **Mesh WiFi system.** If you need whole-property coverage, a mesh system with outdoor nodes works well.
- **Cellular camera.** Some Reolink models support 4G LTE with a SIM card, so they don't need WiFi at all. Monthly data costs around $10.

Most cameras operate on 2.4GHz WiFi, which has better range than 5GHz. If your router broadcasts both, make sure you're connecting the camera to the 2.4GHz network.

## Where to Mount Your Coop Camera

Placement matters almost as much as the camera itself:

**Inside the coop:**
- Mount high in a corner pointing down to get the widest view
- Aim to see roost bars and nest boxes
- Great for watching laying behavior and nighttime roosting
- Protect the camera from dust (chickens generate a lot of it)
- Clean the lens monthly

**Outside the coop/run:**
- Mount facing the run entrance or coop door
- This is where you'll catch [predators](/articles/chicken-predators-how-to-protect-your-flock) approaching
- Weather resistance is critical here
- Point it away from the rising/setting sun to avoid glare

**Multiple cameras** is the ideal setup: one inside, one outside. But if you're only buying one, an outdoor camera covering the coop entrance and run area is usually more valuable for security. You'll catch predators and see your birds during the day.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a subscription for a chicken coop camera?

It depends on the camera. The Wyze Cam v3 and Reolink Argus 3 Pro both offer free local storage via microSD card with no subscription required. Blink and Ring require subscriptions ($3-4/month) for cloud video history. If you want to avoid ongoing costs, go with Wyze or Reolink.

### Can I use a baby monitor instead of a security camera?

You can, and some chicken keepers do. Basic WiFi baby monitors work for checking in on your flock. But they lack weatherproofing, motion alerts, and night vision quality compared to purpose-built outdoor cameras. For a few dollars more, a Wyze Cam v3 does everything a baby monitor does plus much more.

### How far can a chicken coop camera reach from WiFi?

Most cameras work reliably up to about 100-150 feet from the router in open air. Walls, trees, and metal structures reduce range significantly. If your coop is further out, a WiFi extender ($20-40) solves the problem. Place it halfway between your router and the coop for the best results.

### Will a camera scare my chickens?

No. Chickens might be curious about it for the first day or two, especially if it has a visible LED light, but they'll quickly ignore it. Avoid cameras with bright spotlights that activate at night, since that could disrupt roosting. Infrared night vision LEDs (the dim red glow) don't bother chickens.

### What's the best camera for catching predators at night?

For nighttime predator detection, the Reolink Argus 3 Pro is excellent because it has a built-in spotlight and color night vision, so you'll actually see what the predator is (raccoon, fox, etc.) rather than just a blurry grey shape. The Wyze Cam v3 also has impressive color night vision for its price. Pair either with phone notifications turned on so you're alerted the moment something triggers the motion sensor.

A coop camera is one of those purchases that seems optional until it saves your flock. Whether you go budget with a Wyze or fully wireless with a Reolink, you'll wonder how you ever kept chickens without one. It's especially smart to pair a camera with a solid [winter care setup](/articles/how-to-keep-chickens-warm-in-winter) so you can monitor your birds during cold snaps without trudging outside.
