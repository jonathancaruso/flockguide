You go to collect eggs and find something weird in the nest box. Maybe it's a soft, rubbery egg. Maybe it's tiny, misshapen, or has a strange texture. Or maybe there's nothing at all when your hen should be producing. Don't panic. Most chicken egg problems have straightforward causes and simple fixes. Here are the 10 most common issues and what to do about each one.

## 1. Soft or Rubber Shell Eggs

This is probably the most common egg problem backyard chicken keepers encounter. Instead of a hard shell, you find an egg that feels like a water balloon, with a flexible, leathery membrane holding everything together.

**Most likely cause: Calcium deficiency.** Hens need a lot of calcium to form eggshells, about 2 grams per egg. If they're not getting enough from their diet, the shell can't form properly.

**How to fix it:**
- Offer oyster shell free-choice in a separate container (not mixed into feed). Hens will eat what they need.
- Make sure you're feeding a quality [layer feed](/articles/what-do-chickens-eat-complete-feeding-guide) with at least 3.5% calcium.
- Don't over-supplement with treats or scratch, which dilute the nutritional balance. Keep treats under 10% of total diet.
- Crushed eggshells (baked first to remove any egg taste) are a free calcium supplement.

**When it's not calcium:** New layers often produce their first few eggs with soft shells while their reproductive system gets calibrated. This is normal and usually resolves within a week or two. Heat stress can also cause soft shells because panting reduces calcium absorption.

## 2. Thin or Fragile Shells

These eggs have a shell, but it's so thin it cracks easily in your hand or breaks under the weight of a sitting hen. You might notice hairline cracks or shells that feel almost papery.

**Common causes:**
- Insufficient calcium (same fix as above)
- Vitamin D deficiency. Hens need vitamin D3 to absorb calcium effectively. Free-ranging birds get it from sunlight, but confined birds may need supplementation.
- Age. Older hens (3+ years) naturally produce thinner shells as their reproductive system slows.
- High production breeds. Breeds like [Leghorns](/articles/leghorn-chicken-complete-breed-guide) that lay 300+ eggs per year put enormous demand on their calcium reserves.

**How to fix it:**
- Provide oyster shell and ensure adequate vitamin D (either through sunlight access or a poultry vitamin supplement).
- If your birds don't free-range, consider adding a vitamin D3 supplement to their water once a week.

## 3. Shell-less Eggs (No Shell at All)

Sometimes you'll find what looks like a raw egg dropped on the coop floor or in the nest box, with just the inner membrane and no shell whatsoever. It's startling the first time you see it.

**Common causes:**
- Severe calcium deficiency
- Stress (a sudden fright can cause a hen to expel an egg before the shell forms)
- Infectious bronchitis (a viral disease that can permanently damage the shell gland)
- Egg drop syndrome (a viral condition)
- Immature reproductive system in very young layers

**How to fix it:**
- If it happens once, don't worry. It's likely a one-time glitch.
- If it keeps happening to the same hen, check her diet and watch for [other illness symptoms](/articles/sick-chicken-symptoms).
- If multiple hens start laying shell-less eggs, consider infectious bronchitis and consult a vet.

## 4. Bumpy or Rough-Textured Shells

Instead of a smooth shell, you've got an egg covered in calcium deposits, rough patches, or raised bumps. Sometimes called "pimpled" eggs.

**Common causes:**
- Excess calcium. Yes, too much calcium causes problems too. The extra deposits form bumps on the shell surface.
- Disturbance during shell formation. If a hen is startled or stressed while the egg is in the shell gland, the shell can form unevenly.
- Defective shell gland. Some hens just consistently produce textured shells. It's a quirk, not a health crisis.
- Infectious bronchitis (if combined with other abnormalities).

**How to fix it:**
- If you're supplementing calcium beyond oyster shell and layer feed, you might be overdoing it. Oyster shell free-choice is self-regulating because hens eat only what they need.
- Occasional bumpy eggs are harmless. They're safe to eat and just look a little funny.
- Persistent rough shells across multiple hens could indicate a respiratory virus affecting the shell gland.

## 5. Wrinkled or Misshapen Eggs

Eggs that look crinkled, have flat sides, have wavy ridges, or are just oddly shaped. Some look like they got squeezed before the shell hardened.

**Common causes:**
- Stress during shell formation
- Overcrowding in the coop (hens bumping into each other)
- Defective shell gland (genetic, especially in older hens)
- Infectious bronchitis
- A second egg entering the shell gland before the first one is finished (this creates "body-checked" eggs with a visible ridge)

**How to fix it:**
- Reduce stress factors. Make sure there's [enough coop space](/articles/how-to-build-a-chicken-coop) (4 square feet per bird minimum) and enough nest boxes (1 per 3 to 4 hens).
- Occasional odd shapes are normal. Every hen lays a weird one now and then.
- Consistent misshapen eggs from one hen usually mean her shell gland isn't working perfectly. Not much you can do about that, and the eggs are still fine to eat.

## 6. Tiny "Fairy Eggs" (No Yolk)

Also called "wind eggs," "fart eggs," or "witch eggs," these miniature eggs are usually about the size of a marble or grape. When you crack them open, there's no yolk inside, just a small amount of albumen (egg white).

**What causes them:**
- A small piece of tissue breaks loose in the oviduct and triggers the egg-forming process without an actual yolk being released.
- Very common in young pullets just starting to lay. Their reproductive system is still fine-tuning itself.
- Can also happen when an older hen's laying cycle is winding down.

**Should you worry?** No. Fairy eggs are harmless and usually a one-time thing. If a hen lays several in a row, it could indicate a minor reproductive issue, but that's rare. They're actually kind of charming to find in the nest box.

## 7. Double Yolk Eggs

The opposite of fairy eggs. These are noticeably larger than normal and contain two yolks. They're exciting to crack open and they're perfectly safe to eat.

**What causes them:**
- Two yolks are released into the oviduct at nearly the same time and get wrapped in one shell.
- Very common in young hens whose laying cycle hasn't fully regulated yet.
- Some breeds and individual hens are more prone to doubles.
- High-production breeds like [Leghorns](/articles/leghorn-chicken-complete-breed-guide) and [Australorps](/articles/australorp-complete-breed-guide) tend to produce more doubles.

**Should you worry?** Only if the eggs are so large they seem to cause the hen difficulty passing them. Extremely large eggs can occasionally lead to egg binding or vent prolapse in smaller hens. But for most birds, double yolkers are just a bonus.

## 8. Blood Spots in Eggs

You crack an egg and see a small red or brown spot on the yolk. It looks alarming but it's actually one of the least concerning egg "problems."

**What causes them:**
- A tiny blood vessel ruptures on the yolk's surface as it's released from the ovary. That's it. It's a minor biological hiccup.
- More common in older hens and certain breeds.
- Not related to fertilization. A blood spot doesn't mean the egg was fertile.

**Are they safe to eat?** Yes, completely. You can pick the spot off with a spoon if it bothers you, or just cook the egg as normal. Commercial egg operations screen for blood spots (which is why you rarely see them in store-bought eggs), but they're common in backyard eggs.

## 9. Chickens Stopped Laying

This is the big one. Your hens were producing regularly and now the nest boxes are empty. Before you assume the worst, work through these common causes:

**Seasonal changes.** Hens need about 14 hours of light per day for peak production. As days shorten in fall and winter, laying slows or stops. This is completely natural. Check out our [spring chicken care guide](/articles/spring-chicken-care-guide) for when production typically resumes.

**Molting.** Chickens molt once a year, usually in fall, shedding and regrowing feathers over 8 to 12 weeks. During this time, their energy goes to feather production instead of eggs.

**Broodiness.** A broody hen stops laying and sits on the nest (or where eggs used to be) all day. Common in breeds like [Silkies](/articles/silkie-chicken-complete-breed-guide), [Buff Orpingtons](/articles/buff-orpington-complete-breed-guide), and [Wyandottes](/articles/wyandotte-chicken-complete-breed-guide).

**Stress.** Predator scares, new flock members, moving to a new coop, extreme weather, or loud noises can all temporarily halt production. See our guide on [introducing new chickens](/articles/how-to-introduce-new-chickens-to-your-flock) for stress-free flock changes.

**Age.** Hens lay the most eggs in their first two years. Production gradually declines by about 10 to 15% each year after that.

**Hidden nests.** Free-range hens sometimes find a secret spot to lay instead of using the nest box. Check under bushes, behind structures, and in any cozy nooks they can access.

**Illness.** If none of the above apply, a health problem could be the cause. Watch for other [sick chicken symptoms](/articles/sick-chicken-symptoms) and consider a vet visit.

**Diet issues.** Low-quality feed, too many treats, or not enough protein can all reduce laying. Make sure your flock is eating a proper [layer diet](/articles/what-do-chickens-eat-complete-feeding-guide).

## 10. Chickens Eating Their Own Eggs

You find broken egg remnants in the nest box, yolk smeared on the bedding, and fewer whole eggs than you should be getting. One or more of your hens has developed the frustrating habit of egg eating.

**What causes it:**
- Accidentally broken eggs that a curious hen tastes and decides she likes
- Calcium deficiency (hens crave the calcium in shells)
- Boredom from overcrowding or lack of enrichment
- Not enough nest boxes, causing eggs to pile up and break
- Too much light in the nest box area

**How to stop it:**
- Collect eggs as frequently as possible, at least twice a day
- Make sure nest boxes are dark and comfortable. Hens are less likely to eat eggs they can't see well.
- Add curtains to nest box openings to create a darker laying environment
- Place ceramic or wooden dummy eggs in the nest. When the hen pecks them and gets nothing, she'll eventually give up.
- Boost calcium with free-choice oyster shell
- Roll-away nest boxes (where eggs roll to a collection area the hen can't reach) are the nuclear option for persistent egg eaters
- Identify the culprit by looking for yolk on beaks and [isolate her](/articles/how-to-introduce-new-chickens-to-your-flock) temporarily

Egg eating is one of the harder habits to break, so prevention is key. Clean, well-bedded nest boxes with enough space for your flock are your best defense.

## When Egg Problems Signal a Health Emergency

Most egg oddities are harmless glitches. But a few situations require urgent attention:

**Egg binding:** A hen is straining, walking like a penguin, sitting on the ground with her tail pumping, and not producing an egg. An egg is stuck in the oviduct. Warm baths, calcium supplementation, and lubricating the vent can help. If the egg doesn't pass within a few hours, get to a vet. Egg binding can be fatal.

**Vent prolapse:** Pink or red tissue protruding from the vent, sometimes with an egg attached. Keep the tissue moist with a warm, wet cloth and push it gently back in. Isolate the hen in a dark space to reduce laying urge. Seek vet care for severe cases.

**Internal laying:** The hen stops producing external eggs but her abdomen becomes swollen and distended. She may walk with a wide, penguin-like stance. This is a serious reproductive issue that often requires veterinary intervention.

**Repeated soft/shell-less eggs with other symptoms:** If accompanied by respiratory signs, lethargy, or dropped production across multiple hens, suspect infectious bronchitis and consult a vet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are weird-looking eggs safe to eat?

In almost all cases, yes. Bumpy shells, wrinkled shells, double yolkers, blood spots, and even odd shapes are all perfectly safe to eat. The shell is just packaging. As long as the egg doesn't smell bad and the contents look normal when cracked open, it's fine. The only eggs to avoid are those with cracked shells that may have allowed bacteria inside.

### Why is my hen laying soft eggs every day?

Daily soft-shell eggs usually point to a calcium absorption problem. Make sure oyster shell is available free-choice and that the hen is eating her layer feed (not just filling up on treats). Vitamin D deficiency can also block calcium absorption, so ensure she gets sunlight or a D3 supplement. If the problem persists despite proper nutrition, a reproductive tract issue may be the cause.

### Can stress cause chickens to stop laying?

Absolutely. Chickens are sensitive to changes in their environment. Moving to a new coop, adding or losing flock members, predator encounters, extreme weather, loud construction, or even a new dog in the yard can temporarily halt egg production. Most hens resume laying within 1 to 2 weeks once the stressor is removed.

### How many eggs should my chicken lay per week?

It depends on the breed and age. High-production breeds like [Leghorns](/articles/leghorn-chicken-complete-breed-guide) and [Australorps](/articles/australorp-complete-breed-guide) can lay 5 to 6 eggs per week. Heritage breeds like [Silkies](/articles/silkie-chicken-complete-breed-guide) may only lay 2 to 3. Most popular backyard breeds average 4 to 5 per week during peak production. Check our [best egg-laying breeds](/articles/best-egg-laying-breeds) guide for breed-specific numbers.

### Should I give my chickens extra calcium for better shells?

Yes, but do it the right way. Offer oyster shell in a separate container, not mixed into the feed. This lets each hen regulate her own intake. Don't add calcium powder directly to feed, as roosters and non-laying hens don't need it and too much can cause kidney problems. Layer feed already contains baseline calcium; oyster shell provides the extra boost that heavy layers need.
