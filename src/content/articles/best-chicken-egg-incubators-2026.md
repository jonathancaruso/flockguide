## What to Look for in an Egg Incubator

Before diving into specific models, here's what matters most when choosing an incubator.

**Forced-air (fan) vs still-air.** Forced-air incubators circulate air with an internal fan, creating even temperatures throughout the unit. Still-air models have hot and cold spots that require more monitoring. For beginners, forced-air is the way to go. Every model on this list except our ultra-budget pick is forced-air.

**Automatic egg turner.** Eggs need to be turned at least 3 times per day during incubation. An automatic turner handles this for you, eliminating the most tedious part of hatching. Manual turning means opening the incubator multiple times daily, which drops temperature and humidity each time. Automatic turning is worth the extra cost.

**Temperature accuracy.** The target temperature for chicken eggs is 99.5°F in a forced-air incubator. Even a 1°F variance over 21 days can dramatically affect hatch rates. Look for models with digital thermostats and accurate displays. Always verify with a separate thermometer regardless.

**Humidity control.** Good incubators make it easy to add water without opening the lid. External water ports or wells that you can refill from outside are a huge advantage. Opening the incubator to add water drops humidity and temperature, which is exactly what you're trying to avoid.

**Capacity.** Think about how many eggs you want to hatch at once. Small tabletop models hold 7 to 22 eggs. Mid-size units handle 24 to 56. For most backyard keepers, a 12 to 24 egg capacity is the sweet spot.

**Visibility.** Clear lids or viewing windows let you watch the hatching process without opening the incubator. This matters more than you'd think, because on hatch day you'll want to watch every crack and pip.

## Best Overall: Harris Farms Nurture Right 360

[Harris Farms Nurture Right 360](https://amazon.com/dp/B0793HHZ1L?tag=flockguide-20) — **$160 to $190**

The Nurture Right 360 is the incubator that backyard chicken forums recommend more than any other, and for good reason. It hits the perfect balance of features, reliability, and price.

**What makes it great:**
- **360-degree clear view** so you can watch the entire hatch without opening the lid
- **Automatic rolling egg turner** that simulates a broody hen's natural turning motion
- **Auto-stop feature** that stops turning on day 18 automatically (lockdown)
- **External water port** for adding water without opening the incubator
- **Digital temperature and humidity display**
- Holds **22 chicken eggs** (or 12 to 16 with the turner installed)
- **Forced-air** circulation for even temperature

**Who it's best for:** First-time hatchers and anyone who wants a reliable, feature-rich incubator without spending $300+. It's the model most beginners are happiest with after their first hatch.

**Minor drawbacks:** The humidity readings can be slightly off compared to a standalone hygrometer (buy a separate one to verify). Some users report the turner can be noisy. Capacity is moderate; if you want to hatch 40+ eggs, you'll need something bigger.

## Best Budget: Farm Innovators 4250 Pro Series

[Farm Innovators 4250](https://amazon.com/dp/B00TTYLIKY?tag=flockguide-20) — **$80 to $120**

If the Nurture Right 360 is out of your budget, the Farm Innovators 4250 is the next best option. It's been a reliable workhorse for the hatching community for years.

**What makes it great:**
- **41-egg capacity** (larger than the Nurture Right at half the price)
- **Forced-air circulation** with built-in fan
- **Digital temperature control** with LCD display
- **Automatic egg turner** included
- External water refill channels
- Proven reliability across thousands of hatches

**Who it's best for:** Budget-conscious hatchers who want a larger capacity without premium pricing. Also great if you're not sure you'll hatch regularly and don't want to invest $200+ upfront.

**Minor drawbacks:** The styrofoam construction looks and feels cheap compared to the Nurture Right's plastic. It's harder to clean (styrofoam absorbs moisture and bacteria). The viewing window is small, so you won't get the same hatch-day spectacle. Humidity management is adequate but not as precise as pricier models.

## Best Premium: Brinsea Mini II Advance

[Brinsea Mini II Advance](https://amazon.com/dp/B01N56NGS8?tag=flockguide-20) — **$170 to $200**

Brinsea is the gold standard name in incubation, and the Mini II Advance is their entry-level model that punches well above its price point.

**What makes it great:**
- **Exceptional temperature stability** (Brinsea's engineering is genuinely best-in-class)
- **Automatic turning** with digital countdown to hatch day
- **Clear dome lid** for excellent visibility
- Compact footprint fits on a desk or shelf
- **Alarm system** alerts you to temperature deviations
- Built to last for years of hatching seasons

**Who it's best for:** Serious hatchers who want the best possible hatch rates and plan to incubate for years to come. Also great for classrooms and educational hatching projects.

**Minor drawbacks:** Only holds **7 chicken eggs**, which is the smallest capacity on this list. No external water port (you have to open it to add water). The small capacity means you'll want a second incubator if you hatch often or in larger batches.

## Best for Larger Hatches: Brinsea Ovation 28 EX

[Brinsea Ovation 28 EX](https://amazon.com/dp/B01N1PRNYI?tag=flockguide-20) — **$350 to $400**

If you're hatching regularly or want to do bigger batches, the Ovation 28 EX is the best mid-size incubator you can buy.

**What makes it great:**
- **28-egg capacity** for chicken eggs
- Brinsea's **industry-leading temperature control**
- **External water system** with pump for hands-off humidity
- Automatic turning with adjustable intervals
- Digital display with alarms for temperature and humidity
- Durable construction that's easy to sanitize
- Works with a range of egg sizes (chicken, duck, goose, quail)

**Who it's best for:** Experienced hatchers who've outgrown a small incubator, breeders working with specific [breeds](/articles/best-chicken-breeds-for-beginners), or anyone who wants the highest possible hatch rates regardless of price.

**Minor drawbacks:** The price. At $350 to $400, it's a significant investment. The external water system is great but adds complexity. Overkill if you only hatch once a year.

## Best Ultra-Budget: Magicfly Mini Incubator

[Magicfly Mini Incubator](https://amazon.com/dp/B07CB1MBTF?tag=flockguide-20) — **$35 to $50**

If you want to try hatching without committing much money, the Magicfly gets you in the door for less than $50.

**What makes it great:**
- **Incredibly affordable** at under $50
- Holds **9 to 12 eggs** depending on size
- Digital temperature display
- Clear lid for visibility
- Simple setup

**Who it's best for:** Absolute beginners who want to experiment with hatching, kids' science projects, or anyone who isn't sure they'll enjoy incubation and doesn't want to spend $150+ finding out.

**Minor drawbacks:** This is a **still-air incubator** (no fan), so temperature varies throughout the unit and you'll need to monitor more carefully. **No automatic turner** means you're manually turning eggs 3+ times daily. Humidity control is basic (just add water to channels and hope for the best). Hatch rates will be lower than forced-air models with auto-turning. Build quality is what you'd expect at this price.

Think of it as a starter incubator. If you catch the hatching bug, you'll upgrade quickly.

## Incubator Comparison Table

Here's a quick side-by-side of all five models:

**Harris Farms Nurture Right 360** — $160-190 | 22 eggs | Forced-air | Auto-turn | External water port | Best overall

**Farm Innovators 4250** — $80-120 | 41 eggs | Forced-air | Auto-turn | External channels | Best budget

**Brinsea Mini II Advance** — $170-200 | 7 eggs | Forced-air | Auto-turn | No external port | Best premium (small)

**Brinsea Ovation 28 EX** — $350-400 | 28 eggs | Forced-air | Auto-turn | External pump system | Best large capacity

**Magicfly Mini** — $35-50 | 9-12 eggs | Still-air | Manual turn | Basic channels | Best ultra-budget

## Forced-Air vs Still-Air: Which Is Better?

This is one of the first decisions you'll make, and it matters.

**Forced-air (with fan):**
- Even temperature throughout the incubator
- Set it to 99.5°F and the whole unit stays consistent
- Higher hatch rates because every egg gets the same conditions
- More forgiving of minor setup mistakes

**Still-air (no fan):**
- Hot air rises, creating layers of different temperatures
- Must measure temperature at the top of the eggs (101-102°F)
- Requires more monitoring and adjustment
- Lower hatch rates, especially for beginners
- Much cheaper

For first-time hatchers, forced-air is the clear winner. The investment pays for itself in higher hatch rates and less stress. Still-air incubators can work, but they require more experience and attention to get good results.

## What to Have Ready Before Your First Hatch

Once you pick an incubator, you'll also need:

- **Separate thermometer/hygrometer** to verify incubator readings (don't trust built-in sensors alone)
- **Egg candler** (a bright LED flashlight works) for checking development
- **Brooder setup** with heat source, [chick starter feed](/articles/what-do-chickens-eat-complete-feeding-guide), waterer, and bedding
- **A [heat plate or heat lamp](/articles/best-heat-lamps-and-coop-heaters-for-chickens)** for the brooder (heat plates are safer)
- **Fertile eggs** from your own flock, a local breeder, or shipped from a hatchery

Don't forget to run your incubator for 24 to 48 hours before adding eggs to make sure temperature and humidity are stable. Our [week-by-week chick raising guide](/articles/raising-chicks-week-by-week-guide) covers everything you need after hatch day.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What temperature should an egg incubator be set to?

For forced-air incubators (with a fan), set the temperature to 99.5°F (37.5°C). For still-air incubators, set it to 101 to 102°F (38.3 to 38.9°C) measured at the top of the eggs. Always verify with a separate thermometer since built-in sensors can be off by a degree.

### How many eggs should a beginner incubate?

Start with 6 to 12 eggs for your first hatch. This is enough to get a feel for the process without being overwhelming. Not every egg will hatch (expect 50 to 80% hatch rates as a beginner), so starting with a dozen gives you a reasonable number of chicks even with some failures.

### Do I really need an automatic egg turner?

You don't technically need one, but it makes a huge difference. Without an auto-turner, you'll manually turn eggs at least 3 times per day for 18 days, opening the incubator each time and disrupting temperature and humidity. An automatic turner removes this hassle and generally produces better hatch rates because conditions stay more stable.

### How long do egg incubators last?

Quality incubators from brands like Brinsea and Harris Farms last 5 to 10+ years with proper care. Clean the incubator thoroughly after each hatch with a mild disinfectant. Store it in a dry place when not in use. Styrofoam models (like the Farm Innovators 4250) wear out faster because the material absorbs moisture and is harder to sanitize completely.

### Can I hatch duck, quail, or turkey eggs in a chicken egg incubator?

Yes, all the incubators on this list work for multiple poultry species. The main differences are incubation time and temperature. Duck eggs take 28 days, turkey eggs 28 days, and quail eggs 17 to 18 days. Temperature settings are similar across species (99.5°F for forced-air). Humidity requirements vary, so research the specific species before starting.
